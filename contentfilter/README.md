This is a simple content filtering program that i did during the Master Degree in Datamining.  The Big Data subject covered various 
algorithms and our team had to talk about content Filtering. I liked the idea to includea suvey in the class
so that the people could vote for some movies and these were used then to suggest movies that a person would like
based on similiarities.  For that i created this script.
